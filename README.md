# ChemShooter

**Engaging youth with chemistry through a 2D RPG.**

ChemShooter is made with Phaser.js alongside with Webpack for a better development experience.

## Running the Game

The game is hosted on Heroku at https://chemshooter.herokuapp.com/

To run the game locally, clone this repo.

Run `yarn install` or `npm install` in the root directory of this repository.

Then, run `yarn build` or `npm run build` for webpack to bundle all the dependencies into a single `dist` folder.

Finally, run `yarn start` or `npm run start` to run a local web server (by default on localhost:8080) on your machine, which you can then visit in a browser to try out the game.
